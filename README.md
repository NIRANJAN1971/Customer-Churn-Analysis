# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction Dashboard

This project demonstrates end-to-end customer churn analysis, prediction, and visualization through an interactive Power BI dashboard.  
It highlights the workflow from data cleaning and preparation to machine learning prediction and interactive visualization.

---

## Project Overview

The project focuses on understanding customer churn patterns and predicting future churn using a Random Forest model.  
A three-page interactive Power BI dashboard was created to explore churn behavior and prediction outcomes efficiently.

Workflow (described in the project, not uploaded):  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (SQL)  
- Data formatting for dashboard compatibility (Excel)  
- Machine learning prediction using Random Forest (Python)  
- Interactive dashboard design and navigation (Power BI)

## Dashboard Features

- Three connected sheets with navigation buttons:  
  1. **Overview Dashboard** – KPIs, churn rate, customer breakdown  
  2. **Churn Insights** – demographic and behavioral analysis  
  3. **Prediction Report** – future churn forecast and model outcomes  

- Interactive filtering and drill-through capabilities  
- Clear distinction between churned and non-churned customers  
- Key insights and predictions presented visually

## Tech Stack Used 

- SQL – Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Excel – Data formatting and preparation  
- Python – Random Forest for churn prediction  
- Power BI – Interactive dashboard visualization

## Future Enhancements

- Compare multiple predictive models (e.g., XGBoost, Logistic Regression)  
- Real-time churn monitoring using live data  
- Deploy interactive dashboard online using Power BI Service or a web app  
- Automate data refresh and update predictions dynamically.
